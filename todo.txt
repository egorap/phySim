1. get a simple liniar motion animatino to display
2. compute a simple function (cos, sin, cos+sin) and dislay them together
3. get a function for positon of 2 particles and simulate it
4. get the view to adjust to keep the action in
5. add a 3th particle
6. and n particle
7. code atoms push pull physics
	- push/pull mechenics
	- addjust to atomic scale (weights and distance)
^
8. collisitons
9. better view finder
	- addjust play speed
	- have windows focused on individual particles
	- play while generatedin show_state_n() 
	- position velocity visualizer for inital set up
